# Contributing to This Repository

If you have a broker you'd like to add to the list, please
[submit a pull request](https://github.com/osbkit/brokerlist/compare)
that adds your broker to the bottom of [The List of Brokers](./README.md#the-list-of-brokers).

We want to ensure this list has high-quality brokers so it's useful for
everyone. As such, we prefer PRs that add brokers that are actively maintained.
